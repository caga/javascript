		<h3> Javascript Programs </h3>
		
		<p> A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.  In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.  A Javascript program is a list of programming statements.  In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.  </p>

		<h3> Javascript Statements: </h3>

		<p> <strong> <em> Javascript Statements: </em> </strong> </p>

		Values, Operatosr, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

		This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

		<p id="demo"></p>
		<script>
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Hello Dolly."
		</script>

		<p> If you use this script before the paragraph , it will not work as paragragh has not loaded yet. Best place to add script to html is the end of the page after loading every element finished.  </p>
		
		<p> Most javascript programs contain many javascript statements. The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.  </p>
<h4>Semicolons ;</h4>
Semicolons separet javascript statements.
Add a semicolon at the end of each executayle statement:
<code>	
	<pre>
		let a, b, c; //Declare 3 variables
		a=5;
		b=6;
		c=a+b;
	</pre>
</code>
When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
<code><pre>a=5;b=6;c=a+b;</pre></code>
	<h3>Javascript code blocks</h3>
	JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {}. 
	The pupose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. 
	One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in javascript functions.
